    <div class="softwareheadtext">
        IdeaOS is the operating system that powers every IdeaBox. It lets you do things you simply can’t with other
        computers. That’s because it’s designed specifically for the hardware it runs on — and vice versa. IdeaOS comes
        with an entire suite of beautifully designed apps and great feature that no other Operating System has. IdeaOS
        has great inbuilt apps and a high level of privacy and security.

    <div id="jstext1" class="jstext" style="display: block;">Dark Mode is less distracting to the eye and puts the focus
        on your content. Dynamic Desktop
        makes your IdeaBox even cooler with time-shifting desktop pictures that match the time of day wherever you are.
        And Stacks keeps your desktop free of clutter by automatically organizing your files, images, documents, PDFs,
        and more into tidy groups.</div>
    <div id="jstext2" class="jstext" style="display: none;">Files lets you easily browse and organize the files on your
        IdeaBox — and those stored on cloud.
        View files by icons, in a list, or with Gallery View, which helps you quickly locate a file by how it looks.
        Drag and drop files into folders in the sidebar. And use the Preview pane to see all of your files’ metadata,
        quickly create .zip files, and share using the handy Share menu.
    </div>
    <div id="jstext3" class="jstext" style="display: none;">Quick Search helps you quickly and effortlessly find what
        you want, like documents on your Mac,
        movie showtimes, and flight departure and arrival times. Just type a few keystrokes in the Quick Search search
        field and autocomplete immediately shows you relevant results.
    </div>
    <div id="jstext4" class="jstext" style="display: none;">A simple two-finger swipe from the right edge of your
        trackpad brings up Notifications where you
        can see all the alerts that have come in recently. It’s also where you can customize your Notification Page with
        helpful widgets or handy information.

    <div id="jstext5" class="jstext" style="display: none;">Taking a screenshot on the Laptops has always been a fairly
        simple affair of pressing Command +
        Shift + 3 for a full screen capture, or Command + Shift + 4 for a single window screen capture. Those tricks
        work on IdeaOS, but now with a new keyboard shortcut Command + Shift + 5 which will bring up a little screen
        shot capture utility with a full range of capabilities, including taking complete screenshots, partial
        screenshots, capturing windows or apps, and even screen recording tools.
